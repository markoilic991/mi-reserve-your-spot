1. officeSpace service findAll investigate why fetch type lazy do not work
2. method cancelReservation - try delete query directly instead of select + delete
3. officeSpace service delete - check if this method delete officeRooms and working stations that belong to this OfficeSpace + if reservations are deleted (for these working stations)
4. officeSpace service save - check how method save works when we need to update existing entity (when providing only id and description, write test)
5. officeRoom controller - create method findByOfficeSpaceId
